import 'package:zenrouter/zenrouter.dart';

/// Defines the strategy used to serialize and deserialize a route for state restoration.
///
/// ## What This Enum Represents
///
/// When Flutter needs to save your app's navigation state (for example, when the operating
/// system terminates your app to free memory), each route in the navigation stack must be
/// converted to a format that can be persisted. This enum determines which serialization
/// strategy ZenRouter uses for a particular route type.
///
/// ## The Two Strategies
///
/// **[unique]** - URI-based serialization:
/// This strategy serializes routes by converting them to their URI representation using
/// [RouteUnique.toUri]. The URI string is saved, and during restoration, the string is
/// parsed back into a route using your coordinator's [Coordinator.parseRouteFromUri] method.
/// This is the default and simplest strategy, suitable for routes where all necessary
/// information can be encoded in the URL path and query parameters.
///
/// **[converter]** - Custom serialization:
/// This strategy uses a custom [RestorableConverter] that you implement to serialize and
/// deserialize the route. This is necessary when your route contains complex data that
/// cannot (or should not) be represented in a URI, such as in-memory objects, computed
/// state, or data that's too large for a URL.
///
/// ## When to Use Each Strategy
///
/// Use **[unique]** when:
/// - Your route can be fully represented by its URI (path and query parameters)
/// - You want the simplest implementation with no custom serialization code
/// - The route's state can be reconstructed from the URL alone
/// - Examples: `/home`, `/products/123`, `/search?q=laptop`
///
/// Use **[converter]** when:
/// - Your route contains complex objects that can't be in a URL
/// - You need to preserve in-memory state like form data or user selections
/// - The amount of data is too large to reasonably fit in a URL
/// - You want explicit control over what gets saved and restored
/// - Examples: Routes with shopping cart items, complex filter objects, or rich text content
///
/// See also:
/// - [RouteRestorable] mixin for implementing restorable routes
/// - [RestorableConverter] for creating custom serializers
enum RestorationStrategy { unique, converter }

/// A mixin that enables custom state restoration for routes that cannot be fully represented by a URI.
///
/// ## What This Mixin Does
///
/// [RouteRestorable] extends [RouteTarget] to provide explicit control over how a route is
/// serialized to and deserialized from restoration data. While [RouteUnique] routes can only
/// be saved as URI strings, [RouteRestorable] routes can preserve arbitrary complex state
/// through custom serialization logic. This is essential for routes that carry rich data
/// objects, computed state, or information that doesn't belong in a URL.
///
/// ## Where to Use This Mixin
///
/// Apply this mixin to any route class that needs to preserve state beyond what can be
/// encoded in a URI. This is particularly common for:
/// - Detail pages with complex loaded data (avoiding refetching on restore)
/// - Routes with form state or user input that's not yet submitted
/// - Routes with computed or derived state that's expensive to recreate
/// - Routes with objects from your domain model (products, users, documents, etc.)
///
/// ## When Restoration Happens
///
/// **Serialization** ([serialize] is called):
/// Whenever the coordinator's state changes and Flutter needs to save navigation state to
/// the restoration bucket. This happens automatically in the background, typically when the
/// app goes to the background, the user switches to another app, or the system needs to free memory.
///
/// **Deserialization** ([deserialize] is called):
/// During app launch when Flutter detects existing restoration data. This happens when the system
/// restores your app after terminating it, when the user force-quits and relaunches the app
/// (on some platforms), or during development when hot restart occurs with restoration enabled.
///
/// ## How to Implement Custom Restoration
///
/// Complete implementation example combining all required pieces:
///
/// ```dart
/// // 1. Define your route with RouteRestorable
/// class BookDetailRoute extends AppRoute with RouteRestorable<BookDetailRoute> {
///   BookDetailRoute({required this.book});
///
///   final Book book;  // Complex object that can't be in URL
///
///   @override
///   RestorationStrategy get strategy => RestorationStrategy.converter;
///
///   @override
///   RestorableConverter<BookDetailRoute> get converter => const BookDetailConverter();
///
///   @override
///   String get restorationId => 'book_${book.id}';
///
///   @override
///   Uri toUri() => Uri.parse('/books/${book.id}');
/// }
///
/// // 2. Implement the converter
/// class BookDetailConverter extends RestorableConverter<BookDetailRoute> {
///   const BookDetailConverter();
///
///   @override
///   String get key => 'book_detail';
///
///   @override
///   Map<String, dynamic> serialize(BookDetailRoute route) => {
///     'id': route.book.id,
///     'title': route.book.title,
///     'author': route.book.author,
///   };
///
///   @override
///   BookDetailRoute deserialize(Map<String, dynamic> data) => BookDetailRoute(
///     book: Book(
///       id: data['id'],
///       title: data['title'],
///       author: data['author'],
///     ),
///   );
/// }
///
/// // 3. Register in your coordinator
/// class AppCoordinator extends Coordinator<AppRoute> {
///   @override
///   void init() {
///     super.init();
///     defineRestorableConverter('book_detail', BookDetailConverter.new);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Important Considerations
///
/// **Converter keys must be globally unique and stable:** Never change a converter's key in
/// production as it will break restoration for existing users. Prefix keys with your app or
/// package name to avoid collisions.
///
/// **Serialize efficiently:** Only serialize the minimum data needed to reconstruct the route.
/// Large serialized data slows down app startup during restoration.
///
/// **Handle missing data gracefully:** Your deserialize method should handle cases where data
/// might be missing or invalid from older app versions. Provide sensible defaults or fail gracefully.
///
/// See also:
/// - [RestorableConverter] for implementing the serialization logic
/// - [RestorationStrategy] for understanding the available strategies
/// - [CoordinatorRestorable] for the overall restoration orchestration

/// An abstract base class for implementing custom serialization logic for routes.
///
/// ## What This Class Does
///
/// [RestorableConverter] provides the interface for converting route objects to and from
/// primitive data types that can be persisted by Flutter's restoration framework. When a
/// route implements [RouteRestorable] with [RestorationStrategy.converter], it must provide
/// a converter that knows how to break down the route into serializable data (maps, lists,
/// strings, numbers) and reconstruct it from that same data structure.
///
/// ## Where It Fits in the Architecture
///
/// Converters are registered in your [Coordinator.init] via
/// [CoordinatorRestoration.defineRestorableConverter]. When the restoration
/// system needs to serialize or deserialize a route, it looks up the converter
/// by its unique key and delegates the work to it. This architecture allows
/// converters to be reused across different parts of your application and
/// provides a centralized registry for all custom serialization logic.
///
/// The registration and usage flow:
/// ```
/// App startup:
///   Coordinator.init() registers converters
///     └─ defineRestorableConverter('key', constructor)
///         └─ Stored in the coordinator's converter table
///
/// During restoration:
///   RouteRestorable.deserialize(data)
///     └─ RestorableConverter.buildConverter(key)
///         └─ Lookup in _converterTable
///             └─ Call converter.deserialize(data)
/// ```
///
/// ## When This Gets Called
///
/// **[serialize]** is invoked:
/// When the coordinator's navigation state changes and Flutter needs to persist the current
/// state to the restoration bucket. This happens automatically in the background, typically
/// whenever routes are pushed, popped, or their state changes, and the app is in a state
/// where it might be terminated by the system.
///
/// **[deserialize]** is invoked:
/// During app startup, before the first frame is rendered, when Flutter detects existing
/// restoration data. The restoration system calls this method to reconstruct route objects
/// from the previously saved primitive data, allowing the app to return to the exact state
/// it was in before termination.
///
/// ## How to Implement a Custom Converter
///
/// Create a subclass of [RestorableConverter] and implement the three required members:
///
/// ```dart
/// class UserProfileConverter extends RestorableConverter<UserProfileRoute> {
///   const UserProfileConverter();
///
///   // 1. Provide a unique, stable key for this converter
///   @override
///   String get key => 'myapp_user_profile';
///
///   // 2. Convert route to serializable data
///   @override
///   Map<String, dynamic> serialize(UserProfileRoute route) {
///     return {
///       'userId': route.user.id,
///       'userName': route.user.name,
///       'userEmail': route.user.email,
///       'viewMode': route.viewMode.name,  // enum serialized as string
///     };
///   }
///
///   // 3. Reconstruct route from serialized data
///   @override
///   UserProfileRoute deserialize(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
///     return UserProfileRoute(
///       user: User(
///         id: data['userId'] as String,
///         name: data['userName'] as String,
///         email: data['userEmail'] as String,
///       ),
///       viewMode: ViewMode.values.byName(data['viewMode'] as String),
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then register it in your coordinator:
///
/// ```dart
/// class AppCoordinator extends Coordinator<AppRoute> {
///   @override
///   void init() {
///     super.init();
///     defineRestorableConverter(
///       'myapp_user_profile',
///       () => const UserProfileConverter(),
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Important Implementation Guidelines
///
/// **Keys must be globally unique:** The [key] getter must return a string that uniquely
/// identifies this converter across your entire application and all installed packages.
/// Use a prefix like your app or package name to avoid collisions with third-party code.
///
/// **Keys must never change:** Once deployed to production, never change a converter's key.
/// Changing it will cause restoration to fail for users who have saved state with the old
/// key. If you need to change the serialization format, add versioning within your converter
/// instead of changing the key.
///
/// **Only serialize necessary data:** The [serialize] method should only output the minimum
/// data needed to reconstruct the route. Avoid serializing computed values, large objects,
/// or anything that can be derived or refetched. Remember that this data is saved to disk
/// and loaded synchronously at startup, so excessive data will slow down app launch.
///
/// **Handle version changes gracefully:** Your [deserialize] method should be defensive
/// about missing or unexpected data. Users might restore from data saved by an older version
/// of your app, so handle missing fields with sensible defaults:
///
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// MyRoute deserialize(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
///   return MyRoute(
///     id: data['id'] as String,
///     // Provide default for fields that might be missing in old data
///     newField: data['newField'] as String? ?? 'default_value',
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// **Use const constructors:** Converters should be stateless and use const constructors
/// for better performance. The same converter instance can be used for multiple serialization
/// and deserialization operations.
///
/// ## Global Registry Pattern
///
/// The converter registry is a global singleton map that associates converter keys with
/// constructor functions. This design allows converters to be registered once during app
/// initialization and then efficiently looked up during restoration without maintaining
/// references to coordinator instances or other complex state management.
///
/// See also:
/// - [RouteRestorable] for implementing routes that use converters
/// - [RestorationStrategy.converter] for when to use custom serialization
abstract class RestorableConverter<T extends Object> {
  // coverage:ignore-start
  const RestorableConverter();
  // coverage:ignore-end

  /// The global registry mapping converter keys to their constructor functions.
  ///
  /// This table is populated during app initialization via
  /// [CoordinatorRestoration.defineRestorableConverter] and queried during
  /// restoration via [buildConverter]. It persists for the entire application
  /// lifetime.

  /// make your custom converter available to the restoration system. The [key] must match
