/// ## Role in Navigation Flow
///
/// Routes go through the following lifecycle:
///
/// 1. **Creation**: Route instance is constructed with parameters
/// 2. **Redirect Resolution**: [RouteRedirect.resolve] is called if applicable
/// 3. **Path Binding**: Route is assigned to a [StackPath]
/// 4. **Build**: The route's interface is created (e.g. widget for widget-based routers or web page for web routers)
/// 5. **Active**: Route is visible and handling interactions
/// 6. **Pop Request**: User or system requests navigation away
/// 7. **Guard Check**: [RouteGuard.popGuard] is consulted - if it returns false, pop is aborted
/// 8. **Pop Completion**: [onDidPop] is called, result is delivered
/// 9. **Cleanup**: Route is removed from path, state is cleared
