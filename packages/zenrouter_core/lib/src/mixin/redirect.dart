/// Mixin that allows routes to redirect to different destinations.

/// When a route with this mixin is navigated to, the coordinator calls
/// [redirectWith] (or [redirect]) to determine the final destination.
/// This enables authentication checks, permission validation, route aliases,
/// and other conditional navigation logic.
///
/// ## Role in Navigation Flow
///
/// Before any route is displayed:
///
/// 1. [CoordinatorCore.resolve] calls [redirectWith] with the coordinator
/// 2. If the result is `null`: Navigation is cancelled
/// 3. If the result is `this`: Navigation proceeds to this route
/// 4. If the result is another route: Resolution repeats with the new target
///
/// This chain continues until a route returns itself or navigation is cancelled.

  /// - Iteratively follows redirects until a non-redirecting route is found
  /// - Calls [redirectWith] if coordinator is available, otherwise [redirect]
  /// - Handles route discarding for redirected-away routes
