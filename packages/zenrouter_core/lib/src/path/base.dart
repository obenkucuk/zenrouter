/// A container managing a stack of [RouteTarget]s for navigation.
///
/// [StackPath] is the core abstraction for navigation stacks in ZenRouter.
/// It holds a list of routes and notifies listeners when the stack changes.
///
/// ## Role in Navigation Flow
///
/// Routes are pushed onto and popped from paths during navigation:
/// 1. When [CoordinatorCore.push] is called, the route is added to a path
/// 2. The path notifies listeners, causing UI rebuild
/// 3. When [StackMutatable.pop] is called, the route is removed
/// 4. [RouteTarget.onDidPop] is called, completing the route's lifecycle
///
/// ## Types of Paths
///
/// - [NavigationPath]: Mutable stack for standard push/pop navigation
/// - [IndexedStackPath]: Fixed stack for tab-based navigation
/// - `BranchedStackPath`: Fixed layout roots with an independent child stack
///   per branch (provided by the Flutter package)
